### Pedestrian Tracking using Deep Learning

Step 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing

The first step is to collect a dataset of publicly available CCTV footage that includes multiple camera views capturing people walking. This can be done by searching for CCTV footage on YouTube, academic datasets, and other free sources. Once the footage has been collected, it needs to be preprocessed into a format that is suitable for model training. This involves extracting frames from the video, resizing the frames, and normalizing the frames.

Step 2: Person Detection

To implement person detection, we can use a pre-trained object detection model. A popular object detection model is YOLOv5. YOLOv5 is a fast and accurate object detection model that can be used to detect people in real time.

To use YOLOv5, we first need to load the pre-trained model. Once the model is loaded, we can pass the image to the model to detect people. The model will return a list of bounding boxes and predicted classes for each bounding box.

Step 3: Person Tracking

To track people across frames and camera views, we can use a tracking algorithm such as Deep SORT. Deep SORT is a tracking algorithm that uses a neural network to associate people across frames.

To use Deep SORT, we first need to initialize the tracker. Once the tracker is initialized, we can pass the bounding boxes and predicted classes to the tracker. The tracker will update its state for each individual in the frame.

To get the tracking results, we can call the get_results() method on the tracker. This will return a list of bounding boxes and track IDs for each individual in the frame.
